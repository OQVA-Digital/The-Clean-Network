**What does the service consist of? Our office air duct and vent cleaning can include:**

* Inspection of all vents and air ducts
* Creation of negative pressure with a large portable industrial vacuum device to suck all particles inside the ducts into the vacuum.
* Agitating and dislodging dust using rotating brushes, compressed air tools and vacuum cleaners.
* Thorough inspection of the rest of the system (and further cleaning if necessary) to ensure the best air quality.

**Benefits of cleaning air ducts and vents:**

* Improved indoor air quality (IAQ): reduction in levels of carbon dioxide, biological contaminants, harmful particulate matter and volatile organic compounds
* Allergen reducing: improved health benefits - from asthma to allergies
* Team efficiency: improved cognition, productivity and performance
