## **9 of the Best Office Reception Area Plants**

The reception area of an office is the first thing people see when they enter - from clients to employees, this is their first impression of your business. 

This is why it can really help to have an inviting and visually-appealing reception area which sets the tone of your company as well as your office. 

Making your office reception area look good comes down to interior design, from paints to furnishings and more. 

These days, however, there’s been more of a focus on bringing the inside in when it comes to interior decor, adding plants to office spaces to provide a fresh and vibrant edge. 

In addition, certain plants are well-known for helping improve air quality, as they remove particular toxins from the air. 

Finally, plants are fun to look after, if cared for properly, and can give the office a calm and restful atmosphere. 

In this article, we’re going to take a look at 9 of the best plants for reception areas, in terms of maintenance and care requirements, air purifying abilities, and aesthetic appeal.

# 1 - Cacti

Perhaps one of the go-to plants for both the home and the office: the cactus. It’s an iconic house and office plant, and can even flower if cared for properly, adding to its aesthetic appeal. 



This plant is well-known for being extremely low-maintenance. In fact, it really doesn’t enjoy being overwatered, making it ideal for a busier office environment where people may forget to water it. 



While cacti don’t purify the air by removing toxins, they do [release oxygen during the day and absorb carbon dioxide at night](https://promisesupply.ca/blogs/care-guides/what-makes-cacti-resilient-and-magnificent-addition-to-plant-collections), which can help improve the air quality in your office. 

# 2 - Succulents

Another great plant for your reception area is a succulent. 



In fact, this is more of a plant group, but overall, [succulents are extremely easy to look after](https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/gardening/a36078725/how-to-care-for-succulents/), which is why they’re another popular house and office plant, as well as cacti. 



Just like cacti, succulents are also very visually appealing, and can blend in with a wide range of decors, depending on your current designs and colour scheme. They can also flower, if maintained well and kept in the right conditions.



Some types of succulents are ideal for cleaning and purifying the air in your office, such as snake plants and Dracaena. 

# 3 - Monstera

If you’re looking to truly bring the outside in with a larger plant, having a monstera in your office area might be the way to go.



These plants are vibrant and have fun and interesting shapes, making them a great eye-catching piece to add to the interior design of your reception area. 



In addition, they’re really easy to look after, and are able to thrive as long as they are regularly watered and have access to indirect light. 



While they may require more watering and care than cacti and succulents, they can grow to a massive 15 feet indoors, so they’ll give back the effort you put in.



Finally, [according to NASA studies](https://www.cambridgebee.com/blogs/news/monstera-the-air-purifying-powerhouse-for-your-home), the Monstera is one of the best plants to get when it comes to removing toxins from the air.

In terms of maintenance, spider plants prefer bright but indirect sunlight, and should be watered around once per week, making them relatively low-maintenance as long as your reception area has some sunlight. 

# 8 - African Violets

If you’re looking to add a pop of colour to your reception area, African violets are a great option. 



These plants are able to keep flowering throughout the year if looked after and maintained properly.
