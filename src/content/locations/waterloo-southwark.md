introText: "<p>At The Clean Network we believe it’s a privilege to provide <strong>office cleaning services to businesses in one of London’s most creative and culturally rich districts</strong>, where on any given day you can choose between Shakespeare, poetry, street art, cinema, stand-up comedy, cutting-edge theatre, design and art exhibitions, classical and modern music, and more. From internationally respected institutions like the National Theatre and Royal Festival Hall to the vividly graffiti’d “Banksy Tunnel”, Waterloo and the South Bank’s landscape is both brutalist and brightly coloured, and always energised.</p>

<p>Only a short walk away, Southwark’s centuries of heritage has yielded both the Globe Theatre and the magnificent post-industrial Tate Modern, while more recent architectural daring added the iconic London Eye, the old City Hall and the colossal “vertical city” that is the Shard to this incredible slice of London’s cityscape. <b>At ground level, visitors and locals flock to Borough Market for incredible food, and the unique bars, shops and galleries of Bermondsey Street.</b></p>

<p><b>As a valued client in Waterloo and Southwark, you can rely on interior and exterior office cleaning services that are simple and flexible.</b> That means proactive support plus cleaning operatives whose attention to detail ensures a fresh and pleasant environment where your people can focus on what they do best.</p>

panel1Copy: "<h2>Where & who for</h2>

<p>With long experience in office cleaning services, we understand the specific needs of the many different sectors with a presence in Waterloo and Southwark, including property investment, architecture, finance, and tech and software development.</p>

<p><b>Not surprisingly, film and television production, creative design, and marketing and branding are strongly represented.</b> This includes major media corporations like ITV and News Corp UK, based in Bankside’s Blue Fin building. This striking blue-toned is one of many new developments to combine traditional and flexible office space in the area, which now offers many sizeable new builds in addition to its period warehouses and industrial structures and traditional office blocks.</p>

<p>Future plans include a <b>revitalization of City Hall for mixed use</b> and the massive <b>One Waterloo project</b> including significant office space and a new pedestrianised street – The Curve – plus the development of a major life sciences hub for biotech and biomedical specialists.</p>

<p>Our long experience in providing office cleaning services in the West End, Soho and nearby areas means we can handle the specific needs of start-ups, established businesses, and corporates, whatever the sector.</p>"
