introText: "<p>At <b>The Clean Network</b> we believe it’s a privilege to provide office cleaning services to businesses in Westminster, one of London’s most prestigious and visited areas. Not only home to historic landmarks including the official royal residence Buckingham Palace, ancient Westminster Abbey and Big Ben (the Elizabeth Tower’s clock), it’s also the country’s political heart, as site of the Houses of Parliament, 10 Downing Street and key government departments.</p>

<p>In Victoria, technically within the borough of Westminster (one of London’s biggest boroughs), there’s constant activity around its namesake station, which connects southern England to central London and the world via Gatwick Airport. Significant regeneration has also elevated this neighbourhood to serious work-and-live destination level, with plenty of shops, restaurants, bars and international street food at Victoria Market Halls, in addition to its hugely popular theatres.</p>

<p>As a valued client in the Westminster, Victoria and neighbouring areas, you can rely on <strong>interior and exterior office cleaning services</strong> that are simple and flexible. That means proactive support plus cleaning operatives whose attention to detail ensures a fresh and pleasant environment where your people can focus on what they do best.</p>"
panel1Copy: "<p><strong>The Clean Network supports organisations based around Westminster, Victoria and neighbouring areas.</strong> As chosen provider of office cleaning services for start-ups to established businesses across diverse sectors, we can support the wide range of businesses operating here – whether from the repurposed grand Georgian townhouses and terraces so characteristic of Belgravia, Mayfair and St James’s (and where global several corporates like BAE Systems and BP and Rio Tinto have chosen to locate) to large-scale new developments.</p>

<p>The latter group includes milestones like the striking glass Cardinal Place and the asymmetric Nova complex, which have helped to rejuvenate Victoria via mixed office, retail and leisure space. Not forgetting the many flexible <b>co-working opportunities in modernised period buildings</b>, older purpose-built office blocks and new builds that are bringing younger business and new activities to these areas.</p>"
