introText: "<p>At The Clean Network we believe it’s a privilege to provide office cleaning services to businesses in some of London’s fastest-evolving areas. The relocation of the American embassy to Nine Elms has driven investment and regeneration on a huge scale in an area from Vauxhall to the landmark Battersea Power Station conversion, boosted by the Northern Line’s extension to two new stations. The goal is to create 18,00 new jobs and homes over the next 15 years.</p>

<p><b>Vauxhall sits within Lambeth, one of London’s biggest boroughs.</b> It embraces other popular and vibrant live-and-work destinations, notably Clapham and Brixton, with rich cultural heritage and arts and music amenities.</p>

<p><strong>As a valued client in Vauxhall and Lambeth, you can rely on interior and exterior office cleaning services that are simple and flexible.</strong> That means proactive support plus cleaning operatives whose attention to detail ensures a fresh and pleasant environment where your people can focus on what they do best.</p>"

<p>Major employers include publishing giant Penguin Random House and Apple, which in 2023 opened its new UK head office at Battersea Power Station’s former boiler house, constructed around a dramatic atrium.</p>

<p>Mixed-used spaces are increasingly important in Lambeth, according to its council, as a way to <b>support established and start-up businesses in growth sectors like creative and digital, life sciences and low-carbon industries.</b> IT and management consultancy, architectural and engineering businesses are already key sectors here.</p>

<p><strong>Our long experience in providing office cleaning services we can handle the specific needs of start-ups, established businesses, and corporates, whatever the sector and type of office space.</strong></p>"
