panel1Copy: "<h2>Where & who for</h2>

<p><strong>The Clean Network supports clients around the City of London, from St Paul’s across to Liverpool Street, and Old Street down to Aldgate.</strong> As a global financial services centre, this area is home to many international banks, investment houses and global and UK-headquartered legal and professional services firms and other corporate HQs. It’s an exciting place to be and we’re as just inspired by its skyscraping modern icons like the “Walkie-Talkie” at <strong>Fenchurch Street</strong> and the “Scalpel” at <strong>Lime Street</strong> as its historical jewels like the beautiful Victorian Leadenhall Market and the ancient Guildhall.</p>

<p>Our long experience in providing <strong>office cleaning services</strong> means we know how to meet the sector-specific needs of traditional corporates and, more recently, the challenger banks and other fintech companies taking this high-octane district in new directions.</p>

<p>We’re also able to support businesses in vibrant and culturally diverse <strong>Shoreditch</strong>, known for highlights like the converted Old Truman Brewery and eclectic retail pop-ups at Boxpark. <strong>We’re ready to support businesses in an area renowned as a hub for start-ups and for its creative entrepreneurs</strong> – particularly in design, branding and digital marketing as well as high-growth tech and gaming development.</p>"
